# PulsarOS
The Pulsar Operating System

# What is this thing?
PulsarOS is an operating system I started building so I can have a project to work on when I have nothing to do.

# Features
So far, all this OS has is a VGA driver. It displays a couple messages to the screen and that's it. It currently boots using GRUB but I may switch to my own bootloader. Though, that probably won't happen until I take this thing all the way to long mode. A GDT driver has now been added, so there's that.
